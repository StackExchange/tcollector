# scollector

scollector is a replacement for OpenTSDB's tcollector that uses the v2 HTTP API
and integrates better with Bosun.

[tcollector](https://github.com/OpenTSDB/tcollector) is OpenTSDB's data collection framework built for OpenTSDB 1.0. This project aims to make scollector the preferred collector for OpenTSDB 2.0.
